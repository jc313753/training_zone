  <h1> Diggers Beach Volleyball</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Stephen Mintrom<br>
  <strong>Login:</strong> jc313753</p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
	<p>
		Build a website for diggers beach volleyball that will allow for players to register their volleyball teams, check for announcements and to check tournament ladders.
	</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
	<p>
		The completed website should allow all visitors to clearly see any announcements and news.
	</p>
	<p>
		Text should be able to be read easy with minimal eye strain and no need to zooming in? (this is a problem I personally encounter when visiting other websites)
	</p>
	<p>
		Is the overall feedback from the users of the website positive, does it get the required information across and is the site easy to navigate?
	</P>
	<p>
		What could be improved on the website, do pages require redesigning, are there minor things that could be fixed before going live?
	</p>
	<p>
		What was learned from the designing of this website has been learned that if asked to design it again would change how the site was implemented or designed?
	</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
	<p>
		The target Audience for the website is teenagers and young adults.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will target this audience by ensuring that all important information is displayed towards the top of each page such as the announcements and navigation to other pages on the site.
